comprenXible API -- Documentation page 2 -- USER AUTHENTICATION

HOW DOES IT WORK?

When the user tries to log in, send email and password to the API
if they're correct, the API will send back a JSON Web Token (long string of letters and numbers)
then you'll have to include this token as a bearer token in every call to the API for what user should be logged


STEP BY STEP

1 - Ask for Token => 
POST https://localhost:XXXX/api/Authentication -- and send a UserCredentials object, wich looks like this:

{
  "UserEmail": "john.doe@mail.net",
  "Password": "123456"
}

If everything goes alrighty, you'll get something like:  
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYmYiOjE2MjU3NTg3OTAsImV4cCI6MTYyNjM2MzU5MCwiaWF0IjoxNjI1NzU4NzkwfQ.LDSWCQLhqFUsQzasulLW4chlr_NZfWvJiLADmxfXvRw


2 - Ask for Authorization =>
POST https://localhost:XXXX/api/Validation

you'll have to include the bearer token in the authorization, like that:
Authorization: Bearer f4f4994a875f461ca4d7708b9e027df4

Validation is a testing controller that only returns a 200 OK Status when the bearer is correct
