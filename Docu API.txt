This is a Query -- https://localhost:44350*/api/name_of_model/

*This is an example. Here you should type the port that VS uses in your case.
Please note that:
1) this number could change from one execution to another
2) the API program must be running 
3) at a final stage, you'll have to change this route for the stable, online one.

FOR EXAMPLE:

GET https://localhost:XXXXX/api/answers - get all answers in an object list
GET https://Localhost:XXXXX/api/answers/id - get an answer by id

don't forget to check with postman before running code. This is for avoiding despair and hopelessness

the same for POST (add new answer),
	PUT (modify answer)
	and DELETE (I have no idea what this command is supposed to do)
	don't forget to specify the id when targeting a concrete element

in order to POST, you need to send a JSON object like this:

{
  "value": "1 o 2 veces",
  "score": 0.25
}
remember that you shouldn't specify the id when posting


please check database info for object attributes
also, use of Swagger may be helpful. Run it simply by executing the API proyect from VS
contact the API developer only in case of extreme necessity
